                  <summary>How far can an electric car go? </summary>
                  <p class="text">There are a lot of short-range EVs designed primarily for in-city driving, but you can also find EVs that are capable of traveling 300 miles or more on a single charge. Range has always been one of the biggest advantages that gasoline vehicles have over EVs, but that gap has closed fairly rapidly given improvements to the charging infrastructure in the United States. Taking an EV on a long road trip still requires more advanced planning than driving a gas-powered vehicle, but even that is far easier than it was in the past.</p>

                  <summary>How much range would I really need?</summary>
                  <p class="text">The answer all depends on your driving habits, the type of geography you live in, and how far you typically go on a daily basis. For example, a leadfoot driver needs a bit more range than someone who accelerates slowly. EV owners living in flat areas like the Plains, too, can go farther than those living in mountainous areas with the same type of EV. Drivers who carry lots of cargo or many number of passengers in an EV would need more range than a solo driver, for instance. Read more about how to think about and determine the range you might need.</p>

                  <summary>Should I charge my electric car every night?</summary>
                  <p class="text">Maybe. What's best for you depends on many factors like daily use and personal driving habits. However, Level 1 and Level 2 home chargers (unlike super fast Level 3 chargers) are designed to safely charge an EV overnight. Once you're done using the car for the day, letting it charge overnight is fine, often less expensive than charging during day, and is a pretty common practice. Using a few best practices (like sticking with home charging) can help you extend your battery's life, by the way</p>
